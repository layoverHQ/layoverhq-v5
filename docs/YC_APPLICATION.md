### What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

LayoverHQ is an AI-powered platform that transforms airport layovers into curated city experiences. We solve the three biggest layover problems:

1. **Timing anxiety** - Our proprietary algorithm calculates door-to-door timing including traffic, security wait times, and provides guaranteed return times with insurance backing.

2. **Visa confusion** - Instant visa requirement checking based on nationality, destination, and layover airport with one-click transit visa applications where applicable.

3. **Experience discovery** - Curated, pre-timed experiences specifically designed for 4-12 hour layovers with skip-the-line access and guaranteed availability.

We make money by taking 15-20% commission on bookings, selling data insights to tourism boards, and white-labeling our solution to airlines.

### Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?
Currently: San Francisco, CA
After YC: San Francisco, CA (with remote team members)

### Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together.

In 2019, Sarah and Marcus built "FlightHack," a Chrome extension that found optimal flight connections to maximize vacation time while minimizing cost. It analyzed 10,000+ route combinations in real-time and grew to 50,000 users organically in 6 months.

The project revealed that 40% of users were intentionally booking longer layovers to explore cities but had no tools to plan these micro-adventures safely. This insight, combined with David joining after his experience building airline partnerships at Expedia, led to LayoverHQ.

We sold FlightHack's technology to a travel analytics company for $200K and used the proceeds to bootstrap LayoverHQ's initial development.

### How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet?

Sarah and Marcus met at a travel tech hackathon in 2018 where they won first place building a real-time flight delay prediction model. They stayed in touch and built FlightHack together a year later.

David was introduced through a mutual connection at Airbnb in 2020 when Sarah was exploring the airline partnership angle. David had just left Expedia where he'd built relationships with 50+ airlines and immediately saw the potential.

We've been working together full-time on LayoverHQ since January 2024.

## Idea

### Why did you pick this idea to work on?

**Personal pain**: Sarah spent 14 hours in Dubai airport despite being 20 minutes from the Burj Khalifa. Marcus missed seeing the Eiffel Tower during a 10-hour Paris layover due to visa confusion. David saw airlines leaving $50B on the table annually.

**Market timing**: Post-pandemic revenge travel, airline consolidation creating more hub connections, and experience economy growth make this the perfect time.

**Technical feasibility**: APIs for flights, traffic, and experiences are finally mature enough to build this properly.

**Competitive advantage**: We have unique airline relationships, technical expertise in routing algorithms, and deep travel industry knowledge.

### What domain expertise do you have?

**Sarah Chen**:
- Product Manager at Airbnb Experiences (3 years)
- Launched Airbnb Adventures ($50M revenue)
- Stanford MBA, focus on marketplace dynamics

**Marcus Johnson**:
- Senior Engineer at Google Maps (4 years)
- Built routing algorithms at Uber (2 years)
- MIT CS, distributed systems expertise

**David Kim**:
- Director of Partnerships at Expedia (5 years)
- Closed deals with 50+ airlines worth $200M
- Travel industry veteran (15 years)

### Who are your competitors?

**Direct competitors** (partial solution):
- Viator/GetYourGuide: General tours, no layover focus
- Airline stopover programs: Single carrier, limited cities
- Airport apps: Focus on airport services, not city experiences

**Why we win**:
1. Only platform focused exclusively on layovers
2. Multi-carrier compatibility
3. Guaranteed timing with insurance
4. Real-time rebooking protection

### What do you understand that others don't?

**Insight 1**: Layovers aren't operational inconveniences - they're the world's largest untapped tourism opportunity. 750M travelers spending 8-12 hours captive in airports represents 6-9 billion hours of potential exploration time.

**Insight 2**: The anxiety isn't about missing flights - it's about not having a guarantee. Airlines won't solve this (operational focus), airports won't solve this (retail focus), but insurance companies will back it (predictable risk).

**Insight 3**: Airlines desperately need ancillary revenue streams. They make 40% of profits from extras but haven't cracked the layover opportunity. White-labeling our solution lets them capture this without operational risk.

## Equity

### Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity yet?
Yes, Delaware C-Corp (January 2024)

### Have you raised funding?

$500K pre-seed round (closed August 2024):
- $200K from travel industry angels
- $150K from founders
- $100K from FlightHack acquisition
- $50K from innovation grant

### Are you looking for a co-founder?
No

## Others

### If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them.

1. **CrewPass**: Slack for flight crews to coordinate during turnarounds (B2B SaaS)
2. **JetLag**: AI-powered jet lag optimization app using light therapy and meal timing
3. **GateWay**: Social network for airport connections and shared rides

We chose LayoverHQ because it has the largest market, clearest monetization path, and strongest network effects.

### Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.

The Dubai airport sells more gold than any jewelry store in the world - $2B annually. But 95% of those customers never see the actual Gold Souk 20 minutes away where prices are 40% lower.

This crystallized our insight: airports have captive audiences paying premium prices for inferior experiences while amazing alternatives exist minutes away.

Also amusing: The most Googled question in Amsterdam Airport is "Can I leave the airport to smoke weed?" (Yes, you can, and we have a 4-hour "Coffee Shop & Canals" experience that's our #3 seller).

## Curious

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?

Three things:

1. **The network** - YC has backed Airbnb, Wanderu, and other travel companies. Those founders as advisors would accelerate our airline partnerships by years.

2. **The forcing function** - We need to move fast. Airlines are starting to explore this space, and first-mover advantage is critical for network effects.

3. **Pattern recognition** - YC partners have seen thousands of marketplaces. Their feedback on our liquidity strategy and pricing model would be invaluable.

### How did you hear about Y Combinator?
Through Airbnb founders (Brian Chesky spoke at Sarah's Stanford MBA class) and from building in the Silicon Valley ecosystem for 10+ years collectively.
