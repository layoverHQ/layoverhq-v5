## üí¨ The YC Questions

### Why are you the team to build this?
We've collectively spent 30+ years in travel tech, built products used by millions, and have the industry relationships to make this work. We're also frequent travelers who've spent 1000+ hours in layovers.

### What's the insight others miss?
Layovers aren't dead time - they're unmonetized micro-vacations. Airlines see them as operational necessities, airports see them as retail opportunities, but travelers see them as adventures waiting to happen.

### How do you get to $100M revenue?
- 2M active users (0.3% of market)
- 4 transactions/year average
- $50 net revenue per transaction
- = $100M ARR by Year 3

### What's the biggest challenge?
Building trust that users won't miss their flights. We solve this with guarantees, insurance, and real-time tracking that's better than airline apps.

### Why will you succeed where others failed?
1. **Timing** - APIs and mobile maturity
2. **Focus** - Only layovers, nothing else
3. **Tech** - Proprietary algorithms competitors can't match
4. **Network** - Airline relationships from day one
