## What LayoverHQ Makes

LayoverHQ is an AI-powered platform that transforms airport layovers from wasted time into curated city experiences. We solve the three biggest problems that prevent 750 million annual layover travelers from exploring cities:

### 1. **Timing Anxiety** 
Our proprietary algorithm calculates door-to-door timing including real-time traffic, security wait times, and provides guaranteed return times with insurance backing. Never miss a flight again.

### 2. **Visa Confusion**
Instant visa requirement checking based on nationality, destination, and layover airport with one-click transit visa applications where applicable. Remove the biggest barrier to layover exploration.

### 3. **Experience Discovery**
Curated, pre-timed experiences specifically designed for 4-12 hour layovers with skip-the-line access and guaranteed availability. From Dubai's Gold Souk to Istanbul's Grand Bazaar.

**Revenue Model:** We take 15-20% commission on bookings, sell market intelligence to tourism boards, and white-label our solution to airlines.

**Current Traction:** 6,000 beta users, $45K in pre-launch bookings, LOI with Qatar Airways, 87% user satisfaction, 0 missed flights.

## The Problem: $50 Billion in Wasted Layover Time

### Market Size & Pain Points

- **750 million layover travelers annually** spend 4+ billion hours in airports
- **$50+ billion in wasted productivity** and missed tourism revenue
- **68% report layovers as their biggest travel frustration**
- **Average layover: 4.2 hours** - perfect for city exploration
- **Only 3% currently leave the airport** despite desire to explore

### Current Solutions Are Broken

**Airlines**: Offer basic city tours (1-2 options, limited integration)
- Emirates: 4 tour options, manual booking, no timing guarantee
- Qatar Airways: Hotel vouchers only, no city experiences
- Turkish Airlines: Basic sightseeing, no personalization

**Travel Agencies**: Don't optimize for layovers specifically
- Viator: General tours, no layover focus, timing mismatch
- GetYourGuide: City experiences, no airport integration
- Expedia: Hotel bookings only, no activities

**Travelers**: Manual research, often miss opportunities
- Spend hours researching visa requirements
- No reliable timing calculations  
- Miss experiences due to poor planning
- 97% stay in airport despite wanting to explore

## Additional Context

### Surprising Discovery
The Dubai airport sells more gold than any jewelry store in the world ($2B annually), but 95% of customers never see the actual Gold Souk 20 minutes away where prices are 40% lower.

This crystallized our insight: airports have captive audiences paying premium prices for inferior experiences while amazing alternatives exist minutes away.

### Previous Ideas Considered
1. **CrewPass**: Slack for flight crews (smaller market)
2. **JetLag**: AI jet lag optimization (nice-to-have, not essential)  
3. **GateWay**: Social network for airports (network effects too hard)

We chose LayoverHQ because it has the largest addressable market, clearest monetization, and strongest competitive moats.

### What Convinced Us to Apply to YC
Three factors:
1. **Network**: YC backed Airbnb and other travel companies - those founders as advisors would accelerate our airline partnerships by years
2. **Forcing Function**: We need to move fast before airlines start building this internally
3. **Pattern Recognition**: YC partners have seen thousands of marketplaces and can guide our growth strategy
