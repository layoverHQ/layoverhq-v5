## The Problem: $800B+ Market Opportunity

### Market Size & Pain Points
- **4+ billion layover hours** wasted globally each year
- **$800B+ global travel market** with layovers being the most frustrating part
- **68% of travelers** report layovers as their biggest travel pain point
- **Average layover duration**: 3.2 hours (perfect for city exploration)
- **Hub airports** like Dubai, Doha, Istanbul designed for layover tourism but underutilized

### Current Solutions Are Broken
- **Airlines**: Offer basic city tours but limited integration
- **Travel agencies**: Don't optimize for layovers specifically  
- **Booking platforms**: Treat layovers as necessary evil, not opportunity
- **Travelers**: Manually research layover activities, often miss opportunities

âœ“ Aggregates flights from 3+ providers (Duffel, Kiwi, Amadeus)
âœ“ Generates personalized activities for each layover duration
âœ“ Predicts delays and optimizes routing in real-time
\`\`\`
